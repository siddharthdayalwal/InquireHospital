# InquireHospital
Don't get confused, Know it now. 
## Inspiration
Actually this is our first hackathon and we decided to hack for those people who are currently not affected by Covid, We know the affected numbers are large, but the people which are not affected is in majority and taking care of them is also necessary. We all are in Quarantine for now, and in this scenario we can't go outside. So if in case any non-affected person is feeling sick or having any trouble with any disease or is facing some health issues (all apart from covid) they gets confused and below questions comes into their mind:

- Where to go?
- Will the hospital be able to treat me?
- Will the hospital have the specialist I require?
- Will the hospital have medicine which I need?
- Does the hospital have proper facility?
- Does the hospital have required laboratories?

So, helping those who are at home and are non-affected was our main inspiration because many-a-times there comes a news that due to lack of awareness non-affected people goes in a hospital where the Covid patients are there, and due to this they also get affected, so in-spite of breaking the chain, it spreads more! 

## What it does
What it does is really great to know. It helps answer all the above questions which a non-affected person may have. It lists down following information:

- Available Doctors details
- Non-Affected Patients details
- Types of medicines hospital have
- List of Laboratories
- Facilities provided by hospital
- Staff working in hospital

All the above information makes it easier for a non-affected person to decide that whether he can visit the hospital or not. It also helps the person know that where the doctor can be found, what type of health issues other patients have. Knowing list of medicines really helps when person is visiting hospital just to buy them and not for any treatment, so person can be sure before going. 

## How we built it
We wrote the entire code in Java. Then we also made a database using SQLite database. After completing everything with base code and database, we started making the UI and for that we used JavaFX. We also added buttons, text fields and labels. We did major formatting after every completion of stage and also solved many runtime errors.

## Challenges we ran into
It was a great challenge for us, as we lost most of the time in thinking what we would do, we also registered for the hackathon on the last day. After knowing what we are gonna do, we again took time to answer how would we do it. Then we finally started doing this, initially everything was working fine, but later on we were not satisfied with the output which we were getting, so we again started it from scratch. This really increased our heart beats.

Many of the functionalities which we added in our hack was new for us. So, we need to search across various sites to know more about it and we were not having that much time, still by distributing the work efficiently we tried our best.

After few hours we realized that lines of code has increased from where we started, so finding small errors were again a challenge for us.

Not only this, one of our team mate was not having electricity and therefore wi-fi for almost 1hr that too when last few hours were left, this was a nail biting situation for all of us. Rest we tried our best to take up these challenges and avoided it affecting us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As far this is our first hackathon, we are really proud of ourselves that we wrote such a long piece of code overnight, we learned a lot of new things which we don't think would be possible if we would have just lost our hope thinking that we don't know.

This was our first time working with Java Databases. We successfully completed the UI and fixed many compile time errors as well as run-time errors.

In such a less time, we did a lot of things altogether, writing code, surfing things, learning new tech, taking part in workshops, skipped the sleeps, made ourselves proud and many more untold stuffs.

## What we learned
We learned a lot and it was great altogether. As a beginner to hackathon we not only learnt how to build our hacks but also learned how to manage our time and cope up with schedules. 
Working on a big hack idea we got to know stuffs which we were not knowing already. We got to know more about Java, JavaFX, JDBC Drivers, Java-Database connections & SQLLite. We also learned how to make UI using JavaFx and how to use various buttons, text fields, labels and connecting them with database.


## What's next for InquireHospital
We are not stopping here, in such a less time we did a lot and we are sure in coming days we would do great. We are going to add more functionality to it such as below:

- Adding other hospitals as well
- Creating a larger Database
- Developing the UI
- Adding Covid patients details as well
- Collaborate with others
- Do deep research.
- Involve hospitals and doctors for better outcome
- Make iOS & Android application for users
- Publish the app on Play Store/App Store
- Help the citizens of the world

This was the story with our hack, it was indeed a great experience!
Thanks for the opportunity.
Stay Safe!
